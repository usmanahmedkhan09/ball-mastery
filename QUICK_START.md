### 2. Create PWA Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create app icons:

**Option A: Use an Online Generator**
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload a logo or design (soccer ball ⚽ or brain 🧠 themed)
3. Generate and download all sizes
4. Place these in the `public` folder:
   - `pwa-192x192.png`
   - `pwa-512x512.png`

**Option B: Use Figma/Canva**
1. Create a 512x512px design with:
   - Primary color: #10b981 (green)
   - Simple, recognizable icon (⚽ or 🧠)
2. Export as PNG in required sizes

### 3. Customize (Optional)

**Change Colors:**
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to modify the color scheme

**Add More Drills:**
1. Create new component in `components/drills/`
2. Add drill config to `stores/drillStore.ts`
3. Register in `pages/drills/[id].vue`

**Adjust Difficulty:**
Modify drill duration and target scores in `stores/drillStore.ts`

### 4. Deploy

**Option A: Vercel (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

**Option B: Netlify**
```bash
npm run generate
# Upload the .output/public folder to Netlify
```

**Option C: Static Hosting**
```bash
npm run generate
# Upload the .output/public folder to any static host
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors in Editor
These are normal before the first build. They'll disappear once Nuxt generates the `.nuxt` folder.

### PWA Not Installing
Make sure you've added the icon files (`pwa-192x192.png` and `pwa-512x512.png`)

### Drills Not Saving
Check browser console for localStorage errors. Make sure you're not in private/incognito mode.

## 🎨 Design System

**Colors:**
- Primary: Green (#10b981)
- Instinct: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Soccer: Blue (#3b82f6)

**Typography:**
- Font: Inter (loaded from Google Fonts)

## 📱 PWA Features

Once icons are added, users can:
- Install the app on their device
- Use it offline
- Get a native app-like experience

## 🚀 Performance Tips
