# PWA Icon Placeholders Needed

To get custom app icons when users install InstinctFC on their phones, you need to add these image files to the /public folder:

## Required Files:
1. pwa-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. pwa-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

## How to Create Them:

### Option 1: Online Generator (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a soccer ball or InstinctFC logo image
3. Download the generated icons
4. Place them in the /public folder

### Option 2: Design Your Own
Create a simple icon with:
- Soccer ball âš½
- Brain icon ðŸ§  (for cognitive training)
- Green color theme (#10b981)
- White or transparent background

### Option 3: Use Figma/Canva
1. Create 512x512px canvas
2. Design your icon
3. Export as PNG
4. Resize to 192x192 for the smaller version

## Current Status:
The PWA will work and be installable on mobile, but will show default browser icon until you add these files.

## Design Suggestions:
- Soccer ball with brain icon overlay
- Green gradient background
- Bold "FC" or "âš½ðŸ§ " text
- Keep it simple for small sizes
