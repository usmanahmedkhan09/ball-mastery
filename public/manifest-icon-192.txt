This is a placeholder file. To complete the PWA setup, you need to:

1. Create a 192x192 PNG icon and save it as: public/pwa-192x192.png
2. Create a 512x512 PNG icon and save it as: public/pwa-512x512.png

Icon design suggestions:
- Use a soccer ball (âš½) or brain (ðŸ§ ) as the main element
- Use the primary green color (#10b981)
- Make sure the icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using a tool like Figma, Canva, or an online icon generator

For now, you can use a favicon generator service like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://favicon.io/

Upload a simple logo or emoji and it will generate all required sizes.
